# Stock Analyzer

This project utilizes the finnhub.io api to pull current stock data, and the alphavantage.co api to pull historical data. Once the data is extrapolated it is charted to show relevant data, and previous high, low, and closes are charted. Data is styled in an easy to take in format for the user. Only stocks from the U.S Stock Exchange are queriable.

## Requirements
Requires no external libraries. User can clone project and immediately run it using a live server or hosting.
